Write up of how this assignment should be modified to be considered an official assignment in the future:
I would say having a standard language would be great to make grading easier, as well as having a standard language for students to use. Having clear inputs and outputs would be useful as well for more efficient grading. Making use of makefiles or any other listed standard commands that the graders can use to instruct students on how exactly testing would work would be useful as well.
